 ## Description

This project was created using Microsoft Access. 

The database records details of all membership events, including event names, dates, locations, descriptions, and can be integrated into attendance statistics.  The database can be further developed to generate reports and analytics on event history, membership demographics, attendance trends, and other relevant metrics. These insights inform strategic decision-making and help optimize event planning efforts.
